# Quickstart

This quickstart was deprecated in favor of the `beta-2` quickstart found [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html).

This is the most up-to-date and recommended way to get started. This guide walks you through building a fullstack dapp on Fuel. This includes writing, testing, and deploying a smart contract, as well as building a frontend.
